Website for the Howard Chapter of the Society of Women Engineers

## Problem Statement 
The Howard Chapter of the Society of Women Engineers is looking for a central website to display information about the organization and an interactive calendar with information about their current events and activities. They would like the website to show what the organization stands for and how people can get involved with their operations. 

## Proposal
We plan on making the website by following the criterion listed below:
1. Website should be easily to editable without any coding by the organization requesting it
2. A responsive website that displays well both on mobile as well as larger devices.
3. Login/logout functions for the club admins to add/update/delete content.
4. Restricted sign up functionality. New signups must be approved by existing admins.
5. A “get involved” section where people can donate, sign up for volunteer hours, etc.
6. A page where people can register/subscribe for upcoming events of the organization
